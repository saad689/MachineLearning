In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "Three supervised learning models that are appropriate for this problem are support vector machines (SVM), naive bayes, and decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "A support vector machine for a two class case such as this one creates a hyperplane in the feature space. A given sample is then classified based on which side of the hyperplane the sample's feature vector lies. Support vector machines work well for data that is linearly separable, ie samples of each class lie on different sides of a hyperplane. They, however, do not work well if the data is not linearly separable. Also, SVM have a training time which is cubic with the size of the data so they are not suitable for use with large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am hypothetically assuming that the data set is linearly separable just based on my intuition of the various parameters contained in the feature set. Additionally, the data set size is only about 400 points so it should not be too computationally expensive to train and test a support vector machine. For these reasons, I would like to try a support vector machine for this student intervention software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees are good because they contain some inherent feature selection. The top most features of the tree are the most important in determining the final classification. With many features, however, decision trees can become quite complex and overfit the training data. They require some tuning in the training to ensure that the tree does not grow too large to generalize the classification relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this particular application, I want to use decision trees because they will place some inherent emphasis on features which show greater correlation to the graduation of the sample students. In addition, I would like to try an ensemble method to get an idea of the achievable improvement in performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is an ensemble machine learning algorithm. This type of machine learning algorithm learns a weaker hypothesis over a subset of the data. It then repeats the learning over another subset of data which is selected by weighing those points that were classified incorrectly by the initial hypothesis more than the correctly classified points. This process is repeated with each cycle creating a classifier that performs better on the points that were previously misclassified. At the end, all of these intermediate weaker classifiers are combined into one single classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting utilizes probability to combine weaker classifiers into one powerful classifier. I want to utilize the decision tree classifier I develop for this project in a boosting algorithm to see how good of a model I can ultimately develop. The one potential pitfall is if my initial decision tree classifier is overfit to the training data it will not be improved by the boosting. In addition, the decision tree classifier needs to qualify as a weak classifier, meaning it must have an initial accuracy greater than 50%. \n",

    "The easiest way to think about support vector machines is in two dimensions, which means a classifier which uses only features to make a prediction. We can then generalize the methodology to a greater number of features. Imagine a scatter plot in which we plot the number of family members vs. spare time and then label each point as either a successful graduate or a failed graduate. What a support vector machine model does in its training is find a line which best separates the graduated points from the not graduate points. When we receive a new set of features for a given student, we can then locate where it would lie in the plot. Depending on which side of the line it falls, we can make a prediction on whether the student will graduate or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "This same idea can be extrapolated to a higher dimension when we increase the number of features to more than 2. The only difference in this case is that we have a plane that separates the graduates from the non-graduates. This is how the classifier utilizes the data provided for this student intervention system."

    "Overall, however, it appears that the tuning did not significantly improve the performance of the support vector machine classifier. The original untuned support vector machine matches relatively closely to the tuned support vector machine. This may be the case because the original untuned model happended to already reach some limit of linear separability that the data set offered. Perhaps the model can be further improved by tweaking which features utilized.  "
